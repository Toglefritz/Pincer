# Pincer
## A Tiny Robot Arm for Learning Robotics

### Overview

> Pincer is a miniature robot arm project designed for educational purposes in robotics. It offers a hands-on experience in understanding and building robotic arms without > the risk of those hands getting smashed.

Robotics is an incredibly diverse field with applications ranging from manufacturing and medicine to planetary exploration. However, the breadth and complexity of robotics can be overwhelming. The Pincer project aims to provide an accessible introduction to various facets of robotic design and control. This includes hardware and electronics design, communication protocol architecture, mobile app integrations, and inverse kinematics. It's designed to offer a comprehensive insight into the world of robotics, making it an ideal starting point for enthusiasts and learners.

### Project Status: In Development
Pincer is currently a work in progress, with several targeted features still under development. We welcome contributions and ideas from the community to help bring these features to life.

#### Get Involved
